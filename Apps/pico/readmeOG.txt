This is a wrapper as the target binaries are paid binaries. We don't want to promote any piracy with this release. What that means for you? You'll need to provide 2 files:

- pico8_dyn
- pico8.dat

These files need dropping in the pico/bin directory before you try to run the wrapper.

Keybinds:
Select + Menu - quit
Select + Up/Down Dpad = CPU clock modifier
Select + Left/Right Dpad = bezel/Bezel/Overlay modifier
L2 button - Lock into mouse mode, (other input will be disabled while in mouse mode)
      - A/B - click in mouse mode
Select + L1 - reload cart
Select + R1 - change screen scaling

Pico-8 Keybinds are very simple, with A+B being actions and Dpad being movement ofc

Bezel location:
res/bezel/standard
res/bezel/integer_scaled

Overclock digit location:
res/digits
